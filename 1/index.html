    <p>Colorizing the Prokudin-Gorskii Photo Collection</p>
    <p>In order to align these red, green, and blue channels, I implemented both a naive (exhaustive search) to find the displacement vector between 
        one channel and another and a pyramid alignment structure. The naive search aims to find the optimal displacement between one channel and 
        another against a certain metric. In other words, it minimizes loss for the different possible displacement vectors over a certain window, 
        which I chose to be [-15, 15] in both the x and y direction. The options for the loss function were the euclidian distance between the 
        pixel values (L2 norm) and the negative of the normalized cross correlation, which is the normalized dot product between the image vectors. 
        Note that normally we would want to maximize the NCC, but under the hood, I minimized the negative NCC to treat it as a loss function (made
        code cleaner too). Here are images that are suitable for the naive implementation. </p>

    <p> This naive search implementation works fine on lower resolution images, but runtime becomes an issue for higher resolution images. Thus, a 
    an pyramid approach. Under the hood, I implemented this both iteratively and recursively, with starting by downsampling an image by a factor of 2 until it reached a certain small size.

    <p>As you can see from the Emir image above the red channel isn't quite aligned, resulting in a weird ghost-like double image. 
        As explained above the general procedure was to align the red and green channels to the blue one. However, in this case, the jacket, which 
    is a bright blue color, takes up a lot of pixels. Based on this color, </p>
